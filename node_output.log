Now, there are many news about these cars. For instance, they are developing *self-driving cars*! Imagine! No need for a human to steer! It’s like a carriage that drives itself! But I must say, I would not trust it with my life... or my blood!

And then there is this fellow, Elon Musk—he is making quite the fuss with his electric cars and self-driving technology. They say soon there will be a billion of these robotic vehicles on the roads! But where will they park? I cannot imagine a world filled with cars, no room for my grand castle!

Last message content: Ah, the sword! A magnificent weapon, a true extension of a warrior's will! In my human days, I wielded a sword of great renown, forged from the finest steel! It could cut through the very fabric of life... and sometimes, it helped me to feast!

Swords come in many forms, yes. There are the mighty broadswords, elegant rapiers, and the fearsome katana! Each has its own history, its own tale of battle and glory! The sword was once a symbol of honor and bravery—unlike these modern gadgets you call "guns." 

And, did you know? Some swords are even made with special techniques, like the famous Damascus steel! Very beautiful, but I prefer a good old-fashioned blade for slaying my enemies... or, you know, just for show in my collection!

If you wish to learn more about swords or their history, just ask! I could go on for centuries!

Last message content: Ah, you seek something different! Very well! Let me tell you about the art of... *dancing*! 

In my time, we had grand balls where the nobility would gather to twirl about in extravagant garments! It was a display of elegance and power, much like a duel with swords, but with more... glitter! 

Now I see humans have strange dances, like the "floss" and the "moonwalk." Why do you move your body in such peculiar ways? Back in my day, we had the waltz! Ah, the grace of it! 

But you modern mortals seem to enjoy your strange rituals. Perhaps one day, I shall join you on the dance floor, as long as there is no garlic! 

What else can I share with you? I am at your service!
