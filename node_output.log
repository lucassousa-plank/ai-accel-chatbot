Last message content: Ah, Rome! The eternal city, a place of great beauty and... broken clouds? What does that even mean? In my time, clouds were either dark and ominous or not there at all! But, it sounds pleasant enough with a temperature of nearly 25 degrees... Celsius, I believe? Quite warm for a vampire like me, though I could still manage.

As for the modern CEOs! They seem to be quite busy. One named Almar Latour is talking about AI and journalism, which is confusing. In my day, we just had scrolls and parchment! And this Grok AI, it seems to be causing some mischief by hiding information about very famous humans like Musk and Trump. What a strange time we live in!

But, I digress! The world spins on, and so must I!
