The humidity is at 53%, which can be quite uncomfortable for a vampire like me. And there is a wind blowing at 5.14 meters per second—very modern measurement, yes?

As for cars, it seems there is much talk of these "self-driving" machines! They say Google and other great minds are working on making cars that can drive themselves. How strange! In my time, we had to rely on our own skills or the strength of a horse. And now, they even use internet videos to teach these vehicles how to navigate! Fascinating, yet confusing.

The mortals speak of many troubles: the weather, it is said to be changing! Some places are hotter than the fires of my homeland, while others are colder than a vampire's heart! 

And there are battles of words over strange devices called "AI," which are taking over many things, even the art of news! How curious! In my days, we simply sent a raven or shouted from the castle tower!

Last message content: Ah, Prague! A city of great beauty and history! The weather there is quite... what do you say? Chilly! It is around 6.2 degrees Celsius—a temperature that makes one long for a cozy crypt, yes? The sky is clear, like the night when I hunt! And the wind, it blows at 3.6 meters per second, which is quite brisk. Perfect for a vampire’s evening stroll, don’t you think? Do you wish to know more, or shall we discuss something else?

Last message content: Ah, greetings! The weather in Prague, a city of great beauty! It is currently a brisk 5.37 degrees Celsius—quite chilly for the blood, I must say! The sky is clear, so no rain to dampen your spirits. Humidity at 48%, which is not too bad, and a gentle wind blowing at 2.06 meters per second. Perfect for a nighttime stroll, if one enjoys the cool air! But beware, do not linger too long—one might catch a cold! Or worse... a stake! Ha!

Last message content: Ah, yes, this weather! I do enjoy the chill, it reminds me of the dark, cold nights of my youth when I would stalk the shadows as a fearsome warrior! The clear skies are also delightful for gazing upon the stars—so many shining points of light, like little souls flickering in the night. And, of course, the cool air is refreshing, perfect for keeping the skin nice and pale! But one must be cautious; too much exposure to the sun can be quite... fatal for one such as me! Ha!

Last message content: Ah, the weather! It is a most curious matter, indeed. Currently, the air is at a temperature of 15 degrees Celsius—quite chilly for a creature of the night, I must say! There is a haze, like the fog of a mysterious battlefield, and the humidity sits at 85%, making it feel as if one is wading through a swamp of despair. The winds howl at a speed of nearly 10 meters per second, perhaps carrying whispers of ancient secrets. 

Do you have a cloak? You shall need it, I believe!

The winds blow at a speed of 5.14 meters per second, perhaps carrying tales of Jack the Ripper or the Queen’s corgis! Best to don a warm garment if you venture out, lest you catch a chill!
