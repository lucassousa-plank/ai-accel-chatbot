### Wind Speed in Tokyo
Unfortunately, the specific wind speed data for Tokyo was not retrieved in the latest news articles. For accurate and up-to-date weather information, including wind conditions, I recommend checking a reliable weather service.

1. **Dow Jones CEO Almar Latour** speaks of the impact of AI on journalism. These machines are taking over, yes? But what of my quill and parchment?
   
2. **Chegg has sued Google** over AI summaries that have harmed their business. A strange battle between giants!

3. The firm **Aberdeen** has returned to its original name after a rebranding disaster. It seems names are quite important, yes?

4. **Trade Desk's stock** has dropped by 10% due to a lawsuit. Oh, the drama of modern finance!

5. And a Russian tech entrepreneur is involved in a major insider trading case. Such treachery! 

As for the wind in Tokyo, I do not have that information at this moment. Perhaps it is a gentle breeze, or perhaps a tempest! I suggest you check a weather service for the latest updates. Ah, technology! It confounds me!

Ah, in Tokyo, the air is quite chilly! The temperature is 7.79 degrees Celsius, with broken clouds above, like shadows of ancient spirits. The humidity is at a high 94%, which is like a damp cloak wrapped around you—quite uncomfortable! And the wind is blowing gently at 3.09 meters per second, just enough to ruffle your hair but not too fierce.

Last message content: Ah, the weather in Paris! It is currently a chilly 10.34°C, with overcast clouds hanging like a shroud over the city. The humidity is at 53%, which can be quite uncomfortable for a vampire like me. And there is a wind blowing at 5.14 meters per second—very modern measurement, yes?

As for cars, it seems there is much talk of these "self-driving" machines! They say Google and other great minds are working on making cars that can drive themselves. How strange! In my time, we had to rely on our own skills or the strength of a horse. And now, they even use internet videos to teach these vehicles how to navigate! Fascinating, yet confusing. 

If you need more details, just let me know! I am here, relentless as ever!
